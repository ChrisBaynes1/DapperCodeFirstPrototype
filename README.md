# DapperCodeFirstPrototype

Objects that are created in C# will automatically be added to the MySQL database (with MS SQL in the pipeline). The application will have CRUD access to these objects via a CRUD repository that will support several database engines.

Indexing, relational mappings, validation and migration history are still in the pipeline.

# What does this solution provide?

The idea is for developers to spend less on SQL database skills and more on .NET for smaller projects that require a consistent and rapid setup.

# This is just a prototype, it is not production ready.
